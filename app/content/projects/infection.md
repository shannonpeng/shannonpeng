I created Infection with my project team, Team Hedgehog ðŸ¦”, through an intensive exploration of play and product design in MIT's [Toy Product Design](http://web.mit.edu/2.00b/www/index.html) class (2.00B).

We actually started off with a completely different project idea in the beginning of our design process â€” it was during playtesting and iteration that the idea for Infection emerged and our project evolved into what it is today.

## Gameplay

In Infection, there are two teams â€” <span style="color:#ed7576">**red**</span> and <span style="color:#7cc8f2">**blue**</span>. All players wear skeleton **vests** and start with four **organs**: one heart, two lungs, and one stomach.

Each player carries **bacteria** to throw at other players. When the bacteria strike another player's organ, the organ falls off their vest! To defend themselves, players must use their **antibodies** to block incoming bacteria.

A player is eliminated when all four of their organs (or their heart) have been knocked off their vest. A team wins when all the other team's players have been eliminated from the game.

## Ideation

The first step in our design process was to think of as many toy design ideas as possible. As we learned, the key to successful brainstorming is to keep a continuous stream of ideas going. The 2.00B course staff kept us on our toes with numerous ideation challenges in class.

##### Ideation challenges in 2.00B lecture.

</div>

We documented each of our ideas with a one-page sketch. Here are two refined illustrations I made for a modular light-up train named "Light Rail" and a puzzle game titled "Impossible Structures."

##### Initial concept sketches for toy designs.

</div>

In lab, we pitched our sketches to our teams, pinned them to a board, and then categorized and discussed them. Some factors we used to evaluate our ideas included:

- **Novelty:** How new and exciting is the toy idea?
- **Replayability:** How different is play each time? Will it still be exciting the *n*th time the toy is played with?
- **Feasibility:** Can we feasibly build a prototype of this toy within the span of a month?
- **Safety:** Potentially dangerous toys don't fare well with parents, who are the people deciding whether to purchase the toy for their kids.

## Poster Pitches

We narrowed our team's initial sketches down to our top three ideas, for which we created large, interactive posters to pitch to the entire class.

##### Crafting and presenting posters for our top three toy ideas.

</div>

Using feedback from both instructors and kids, we selected the most promising two ideas â€” Impossible Structures and Light Rail â€” to move into the next phase: sketch models.

## Sketch Models

Building sketch models is a useful way to quickly test a product idea. For each of Light Rail and Impossible Structures, we created a *looks like* model, to show how the toy would look to scale, and a *plays like* model, to explore potential interactions.

</div>

### Impossible Structures

**Plays Like:** Impossible Structures enables kids to build seemingly gravity-defying sculptures. To achieve this effect, we cut large foam blocks using hot wire and covered them with strips of Velcro.

**Looks Like:** We envisioned the final toy to be constructed from wood, so our *looks like* model took the form of small wooden blocks with magnets embedded inside.

### Light Rail

**Plays Like:** Light Rail is a modular train that lights up in different combinations depending on how its cars are connected. Our *plays like* model consisted of spray-painted foam blocks with LED strips on top.

**Looks Like:** Our *looks like* model took the form of foam board pieces cut and glued together to form a modern lightrail.

##### Getting feedback at the 2.00B Sketch Model Expo.

</div>

Some feedback we received from mentors and instructors included:

- **Velcro vs. Magnets:** There is a big difference between velcro and magnets â€” magnets limit the possible ways we can connect the blocks, while Velcro grants us multiple degrees of freedom (it doesn't even require 90Âº angles). Velcro might be more fun for kids, because it allows for more freeform play. Also, what if we turned the entire structure upside down so it hangs like a bat?
- **Trains Need...:** Instructors were skeptical that kids would be entertained purely by colored LEDs and rearranging train carsâ€”also, if we're going to make a toy that resembles a train, they'd expect it to have wheels and/or be motorized, and make sound.


## Playtesting

To get more feedback, we brought our sketch models to the MIT Museum, where we could playtest with our target audience â€” real kids.

The first thing we noticed was that the kids who visited our table immediately gravitated toward the Impossible Structures Velcro blocks. *What's that weird looking sculpture? I wanna check that out.*

We were surprised to find that instead of piecing blocks together by hand, kids liked to stand back and throw blocks at the sculpture to add to it â€” they were amused that the block could stick where it hit the sculpture. We made up a game where we would take turns throwing blocks at the sculpture to see who would be the one to knock it down, and the kids enjoyed it.

At the end of the day, we realized that **kids really like throwing things.** And many also liked throwing things at each other.

##### Playtesting our sketch models with real kids.

</div>

It seemed that Impossible Structures was winning, not for the appeal of building with the Velcro blocks, but for throwing them. How could we take the Velcro blocks of Impossible Structures in a new direction?

It was then that the idea for Infection was born.

## Prototyping

It was quite late into the semester to switch ideas, but our team had full faith in our new game and its appeal to kids. We dove into the next stage of the process: prototyping.

**Organs and Antibodies:** We traced organ and antibody shapes onto foam blocks, cut them on a hot wire, and sanded them. Later, we spray painted them and covered them in Velcro strips.

**Bacteria:** We ordered red Veltex online, cut bacteria shapes, inserted stuffing, and sewed the pieces together. We added parachute cord for the flagella.

**Vests:** We cut torso-sized pieces of neoprene and stitched on a ribcage pattern cut from Veltex.

##### Building our final Infection prototypes.

</div>

We tested our new prototypes and came up with gameplay rules by playing multiple rounds of Infection outside of lab (the best kind of homework).

We adjusted the organs' attachment to the vests until they were attached tightly enough to not fall off accidentally while a player was running, but loosely enough so that an incoming bacteria could cleanly knock the organ off. After some finishing touches, our final prototype was ready to *play*sent!

## What I Learned

2.00B is one of my favorite classes I took at MIT. I got my first hands-on introduction to the product design process, witnessed the value of playtesting first-hand, and gained experience with fabrication techniques, while having lots of fun along the way.

The class offered a very playful and supportive environment, and it inspired me to learn more about product design!
